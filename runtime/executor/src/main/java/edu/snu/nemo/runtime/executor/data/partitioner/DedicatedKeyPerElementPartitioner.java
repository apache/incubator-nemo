 * An implementation of {@link Partitioner} which assigns a dedicated key per an output data from a task.
 * WARNING: Because this partitioner assigns a dedicated key per element, it should be used under specific circumstances
 * that the number of output element is not that many. For example, every output element of
 * {@link edu.snu.nemo.common.ir.vertex.transform.RelayTransform} inserted by large shuffle optimization is always
 * a partition. In this case, assigning a key for each element can be useful.
