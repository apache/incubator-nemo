/**
 * An implementation of {@link Partitioner} which hashes output data from a source task appropriate to detect data skew.
 * It hashes data finer than {@link HashPartitioner}.
 * The elements will be hashed by their key, and applied "modulo" operation.
 *
 * When we need to split or recombine the output data from a task after it is stored,
 * we multiply the hash range with a multiplier, which is commonly-known by the source and destination tasks,
 * to prevent the extra deserialize - rehash - serialize process.
 * For more information, please check {@link edu.snu.nemo.conf.JobConf.HashRangeMultiplier}.
